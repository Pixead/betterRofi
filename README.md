# betterRofi
A suit of diffrent rofi based tools made to increase efficency

Hi that's my first real project as well !

Juste a little instruction about the instalation:
- you can copy the files everywhere on your linux device
- compile all the .cpp files using $```g++ *.cpp```
- and finaly move the .betterRofi folder to your .config file

The theme is one of the themes that are available on the:
